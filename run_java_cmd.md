- In a text editor type:

class apples {
	public static void main(String args[]){
		System.out.println("Hello World");
		}
}

- Save it as `test.java`
- Navigate the path of the file in `cmd`
- in `cmd` type `javac test.java` 
- It won't show anything 
- type `dir` and there should be `apple.class` file 
- run `java apple` and 
- there should be `Hello World` message
